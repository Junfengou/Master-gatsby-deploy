// This file serve as a gateway for connecting gatsby to sanity, so we can use GraphiQL to query data


/*
    IMPORTANT NOTE: refer to [An intro to gatsby-config and sourcing data video]
        In the documentation of Gatsby-config, it's listed to use...
            module.exports = {....}
                this is known as the common JS syntax

        In Node JS, You can do this
            export default {....}
                this is known as the ES module
                To make this work, [package.json] have a script option : ("build": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=\"-r esm\" gatsby build",)

            
*/

/*
    ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:
        In order to surface sanity data, you need various plug-ins
*/

// side note: All the plug-ins are installed via npm in the [package.json] under dependencies 
    // token is obtained from setting => API => Tokens => generate read only token 


import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config({ path: '.env' }); //piping the env file in here

    /*
        IMPORTANT NOTE TO SELF:
            next time building this project...
                after specifying the plugins, run this command on the backend [sanity graphql deploy (name of dataset)]
                Sanity on have their own API, we need to convert it to Gatsby's API so we can query the data
